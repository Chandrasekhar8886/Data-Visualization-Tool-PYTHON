# Data Visualization Tool (Python)

## Overview

This project is a **Python-based Data Visualization Tool** that analyzes datasets and generates meaningful visual insights.
It uses **Pandas for data processing** and **Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization** to explore patterns, relationships, and trends within the dataset.

The project demonstrates **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **data visualization techniques** commonly used in data analytics.

## Features

* Load and analyze CSV datasets
* Perform **data preprocessing and cleaning**
* Generate multiple visualizations including:

  * Bar charts
  * Scatter plots
  * Heatmaps
  * Distribution plots
* Identify patterns and relationships between variables

---

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Dataset

The project uses an **employees dataset** containing information such as:

* Employee name
* Age
* Department
* Salary

The dataset is stored in:

```
employees.csv
```
